# In the TestCases/ directory, we would like to
# ignore any of the data needed to run the cases
# or their output data, i.e., meshes, solution
# files, restart files, CSVs, etc. This will
# also be useful in that we can merge in the 
# independent TestCases/ repo that contains only
# this data without corrupting our current SU2/
# repo or accidentally commiting large file or
# changes to the meshes/solutions/restarts.

# Things appearing in TestCases/ repo to ignore:
# mesh files
*.su2
*.cgns
*.pw

# binary/ascii restart/solution files. Note that .csv can be a history, of_grad, etc file as well.
*.dat
*.csv

# auto-generated files by regression tests
*.autotest
config_*.cfg

# flip the pickle
*.pkl

*.IGS
*.tgz
